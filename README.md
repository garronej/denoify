> 🗣️ If your project has **no dependencies** and **is not using any Node builtins** (fs, https, process ect...), you will soon be able to do

> For NPM module authors this means that you jus need to tell your users to import your module like:

> Knowing that why would you want to use Denoify?

> -   To publish your module on [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x). You have very few chances to see your module

> -   If your module belong in the 10% of NPM modules that doesn't work out of the box. Denoify can help you

# What it is

A build tool that takes as input a TypeScript codebase that was meant to target node and/or the web and spits out a modified version of the source files ready to be deployed as a Deno module.

![what_denoify_does](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/85449626-41b10c80-b598-11ea-91cc-6805facab1dd.png)

> **NOTE:** Denoify won't run on Deno, it is a Node module.

> **NOTE:** Denoify is capable of **recursively** resolving **dependencies**!  
> It works out of the box with dependencies that uses denoify
> and there are many option for dealing with dependencies that won't transpile automatically. [See specific documentation](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module)

This tool is mainly for NPM module maintainer, to enable them to bring first-class citizen Deno support to their modules and do so without introducing breaking changes.

# Example of modules using Denoify

Some modules that have been made cross-runtime using Denoify:

-   [hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono)
-   [EVT](https://evt.land)
-   [Nano JSX](https://github.com/nanojsx/nano)
-   [eta](https://deno.land/x/eta@v1.3.0)
-   [graphql-helix](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix)
-   [tsafe](https://github.com/garronej/tsafe)
-   [...and many others](https://github.com/garronej/denoify/network/dependents?dependent_type=PACKAGE)

# Limitations

Coming up next is a detailed guide on how to set up denoify with your project and how
to publish on [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) but before anything
here are the current limitations you need to be aware of.

-   If your module is vanilla JS it needs to be ported to TypeScript first. (1)
-   `require()` is not supported.
-   You can't `fs.readFile()` files that are part of the module ( files inside a `res/`
    directory for example ). (2)

(1) _Don't be afraid, renaming your source with `.ts` and dropping some `any` here
and there will do the trick.
You will be able to pull it off even if you aren't familiar with typescript. [Ref](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module#enable-strict-mode-and-fixes-errors-if-any)_

(2) _In Deno the files that forms your module won’t be pre-fetched and
placed in `node_module` like in node so you won’t be able to access files that are not
on the disk._

# What's new

**NEW IN v1.3.1**

-   Denoify now has [a proper documentation website](https://docs.denoify.land)!

**NEW IN v1.3**

-   Support for `// @denoify-line-ignore` special comment.

**NEW IN v1**

-   `import express from "express";` automatically converted into:  
    `import express from "npm:express@5";`  
    (See [this update](https://deno.com/blog/changes#compatibility-with-node-and-npm))  
    Most project will now transpile successfully out of the box.

**NEW IN v0.10**

-   Mitigate the risk of comment being accidentally modified.
-   Possibility to specify output directory in the package.json's denoify field. [See doc](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module#optional-step-45-specify-the-output-directory).
-   Support module augmentation: `declare module ...`. [Example](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/60250b9de118d4939374368ca1be665bac871769/src/Endomorphism.ts#L40)
-   Possibility to explicitly tell where the `index.ts` is located in the source. [Doc](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module#optional-step-475-specify-where-the-indexts-is-located-in-your-source)

**NEW IN v0.9**

-   `tsconfig.json` can be absent if outputDir is specified. [See @zxch3n's PR](https://github.com/garronej/denoify/pull/32)
-   Enable to configure the name of the output dir. It no longer has to be `deno_dist`. [See @zxch3n's PR](https://github.com/garronej/denoify/pull/31)

**NEW IN v0.7**

-   Support for esm modules. See [issue](https://github.com/garronej/denoify/issues/29). Thanks to [yandeu](https://github.com/yandeu).

**NEW IN v0.7**

-   Support for workspaces where `node_modules` are located in a parent directory.  
    Thx [@hayes](https://github.com/hayes) [See issue](https://github.com/garronej/denoify/issues/23)
-   Add basic support for child_process.spawn ([#785](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/785))

**NEW IN v0.6**

-   Built in support for [graphQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql).  
    See how [graphql-helix](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix) got graphql working before `v0.6` using a [custom replacer](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/blob/79e863288a93d1b491caeca32a4124f97465d5a6/scripts/denoify-replacer.js)
    referenced in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/blob/79e863288a93d1b491caeca32a4124f97465d5a6/package.json).  
    You can do the same with other modules using [skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/) or [jspm](https://jspm.org/)
-   It is now possible to use `console.log()` in custom replacers to help debug.
-   [Some support](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/8191) for `crypto` node builtin.

**NEW IN v0.5** _Breaking changes_

-   All Denoify parameters are now gathered under a uniq `"denoify"` field.
-   Possibility to specify which files should be copied to the `deno_dist` directory (Previously only `README.md` was copied).  
    [Valid config example](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module/blob/master/package.json)
